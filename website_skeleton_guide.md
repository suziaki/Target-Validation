# Website Skeleton Guide

This guide will help you to get the skeleton of a website up and running. 

## Step 1: Review the Repository

First, you need to review the entire repository. You can use the `repository_reviewer.py` script for this. 

```python
import repository_reviewer

repository_path = "<your_repository_path>"
review_results = repository_reviewer.review(repository_path)
```

Replace `<your_repository_path>` with the path of your repository.

## Step 2: Create the Website Skeleton

Next, you need to create the website skeleton. You can use the `website_skeleton_guide_creator.py` script for this. 

```python
import website_skeleton_guide_creator

guide_content = website_skeleton_guide_creator.create(review_results)
```

## Step 3: Understand the Website Skeleton

The website skeleton consists of various DOM elements, messages, and functions. 

### DOM Elements

The following are the IDs of the DOM elements that the JavaScript functions will use:

```python
print(DOM_element_ids)
```

### Messages

The following are the names of the messages that will be used in the guide:

```python
print(message_names)
```

### Functions

The following are the names of the functions that will be used in the guide:

```python
print(function_names)
```

## Step 4: Run the Website

Finally, you can run the website. Make sure to replace `<your_website_path>` with the path of your website.

```python
import webbrowser

webbrowser.open_new_tab('<your_website_path>')
```

Congratulations! You now have the skeleton of a website up and running.
