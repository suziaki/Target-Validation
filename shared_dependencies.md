As the task is to generate a single text file ("instructions.txt") that provides instructions on how to create a website, there are no shared dependencies in this context. This is because a text file does not have dependencies such as exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, or function names. It's a standalone file that contains plain text.
