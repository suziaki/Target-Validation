1. "food.pdf": This is the input file that the program will read. It's not clear what the content of this file is, but it's likely to be data that the hit recognition program will use.

2. "hit_recognition_plan.py": This is the Python script that will be generated. It will use PyTorch or TensorFlow libraries for hit recognition. The specific functions and variables used will depend on the details of the hit recognition task, but they might include things like "model", "train", "test", "accuracy", etc.

3. "results.txt": This is the output file where the plan for the hit recognition program will be written. It might include things like the structure of the neural network, the training process, the testing process, etc.

Shared Dependencies:

1. PyTorch/TensorFlow: These are the libraries that will be used for hit recognition. They will be imported in "hit_recognition_plan.py".

2. PDF Reader: A library or module that can read PDF files will be needed. This will be used in "hit_recognition_plan.py" to read "food.pdf".

3. File I/O: Both "hit_recognition_plan.py" and "results.txt" will use Python's built-in file I/O functions to read from and write to files.

4. Data: The data in "food.pdf" is a shared dependency, as it will be used in "hit_recognition_plan.py" and the results will be written to "results.txt".

5. Hit Recognition Algorithm: The specific algorithm used for hit recognition is a shared dependency. It will be implemented in "hit_recognition_plan.py" and the plan for it will be written to "results.txt".
