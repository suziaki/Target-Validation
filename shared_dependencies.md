Shared Dependencies:

1. Scrapy: This is a Python framework for web scraping that will be used across all the files for extracting data from websites.

2. PyTorch: This is a Python-based scientific computing package that will be used in "pytorch_model.py" and "data_processing.py" for handling datasets.

3. JSON: This is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write. It will be used in "pipelines.py" for storing scraped data in a structured format.

4. ncbi_spider: This is the name of the spider class in "ncbi_spider.py" that will be used for scraping data from ncbi.gov. It will be referenced in "main.py" to initiate the scraping process.

5. Items: This is a container for scraped data in "items.py". It will be used in "ncbi_spider.py" to define the data fields for scraping and in "pipelines.py" to process the scraped data.

6. Pipelines: This is a series of processing steps in "pipelines.py" that will be used to handle the data extraction and storage process. It will be referenced in "settings.py" to configure the item pipelines.

7. Middlewares: This is a series of hooks in "middlewares.py" that will be used to handle requests and responses. It will be referenced in "settings.py" to configure the downloader middlewares.

8. Settings: This is a configuration file in "settings.py" that will be used to define settings for the Scrapy project. It will be referenced in "main.py" to configure the Scrapy settings.

9. setup: This is a setup script in "setup.py" that will be used to package the project. It will be referenced in "main.py" to setup the project.

10. data_processing: This is a module in "data_processing.py" that will be used to process the scraped data. It will be referenced in "main.py" to process the data.

11. main: This is the main script in "main.py" that will be used to run the project. It will reference all the other modules to initiate the scraping process.
