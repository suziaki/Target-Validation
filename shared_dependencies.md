As the prompt only mentions the creation of a single database file, there are no shared dependencies between multiple files. However, within the context of the single database file "esac_library.db", there could be several elements that could be considered as dependencies. These might include:

1. Database Schema: The structure of the ESAC library database, including tables, fields, and relationships between them.

2. Table Names: Names of the tables that store the ESAC library data.

3. Field Names: Names of the fields within each table.

4. Primary and Foreign Keys: Unique identifiers for records in the tables, and their relationships.

5. SQL Queries: Any SQL queries used to manipulate or retrieve data from the ESAC library.

6. Stored Procedures and Functions: Any stored procedures or functions used within the database.

7. Triggers: Any database triggers used for maintaining data integrity or automating tasks.

8. Indexes: Any indexes used to optimize data retrieval.

9. Views: Any views created for simplifying complex queries or for security purposes.

10. Connection Strings: Information used to connect to the database.

Please note that these are potential dependencies within the database file itself, and not shared dependencies between multiple files.
